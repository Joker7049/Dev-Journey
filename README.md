# 📘 Learning Journal  

Hi, I’m Asad 👋 This repo is where I track my journey of learning **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Mobile App Development**.  
I’ll be logging what I learn week by week, the projects I work on, and challenges I face along the way.

## 🗓 Weekly Progress  

### Week 1  
- Learned basic **Jetpack Compose components** (Text, Button, Column, Row).  
- Built a simple “Hello World” Android app.  
- Practiced pushing my first repo to GitHub.  

### Week 2  
- Explored **state management** in Jetpack Compose.  
- Created a **Counter App** with increment/decrement buttons.  
- Set up my first **Kotlin Multiplatform project**.  

### Week 3  
- Started working on my **Daily Quote Saver** project.  
- Learned to use **DataStore library** for local storage.  
- Faced issues with Gradle setup → solved them with online research and the help of AI.

## 🚀 Goals

## ✍️ Notes to Myself  
- Don’t worry about making “perfect” projects — just build.  
- Push code often, even small progress matters.  
- Consistency > speed.
